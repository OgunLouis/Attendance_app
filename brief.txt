Sign-Out Functionality: Track when an individual signs out and store that time as well. This would help calculate the total time spent.

Time Tracking Report: Generate a report summarizing how long each individual stayed. It could display total hours per person or per department.

Search Feature: Allow searching the text file for a specific name or department to quickly retrieve their sign-in and sign-out times.

Data Validation: Ensure that names and departments are correctly formatted and not left blank when input is collected.

User Authentication: Add a simple authentication system where only authorized users can access and modify the sign-in system.

Timestamp Format Options: Give users the option to choose how the time is displayed (e.g., 12-hour or 24-hour format).

Statistics Dashboard: Display some basic statistics like the average time people spend, the busiest times, or which department has the most entries.

Export Data: Allow exporting data to a CSV or Excel file for further analysis.

Alerts or Reminders: Set up reminders if someone forgets to sign out or if their time logged exceeds a certain limit.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): If you're interested, you could create a simple GUI using a library like Tkinter to make it more user-friendly.
